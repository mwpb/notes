# Empricial evaluation guidelines

PL = Programming Languages
ACM = Association for Computing Machinery
SIGPLAN = ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages

Research into programming languages often produces ideas whose worth is evaluated empirically.
In 2017 an ad hoc committee formed by SIGPLAN created a checklist for encouraging best practices around the creation and evaluation of empirical evidence.

## Preliminary result: empirical evaluation checklist

The expert members of the committee examined the programming languages literature and evaluated forms of empirical evaluation commonly found there.
The result was a checklist of seven important critera and examples of common mistakes that failed to meet each criteron.

1. Clearly stated claims
2. Suitable comparison
3. Principled benchmark choice
4. Adequate data analysis
5. Relevant metrics
6. Appropriate and clear experimental design
7. Appropriate presentation of results

## Scope and potential limitations

The checklist is intended to supplement expert judgement and ensure that (as a community) our current knowledge is correctly applied.
In addition the checklist is not intended to be exaustive but instead to reflect what is most common in PL empirical evaluations.

There is a potential problem in the recommendation to prefer standard benchmarking suites: as a community we may produec results tailored to these suites.
However the judgement of the committee is that PL research suffers more from inability to compare papers than overfitting on a set of benchmarking suites.

In general, the checklist is an evolving work.
Feedback has been incorporated and is requested in the future.
